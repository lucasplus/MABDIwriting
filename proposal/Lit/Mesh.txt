Incremental Probabilistic Geometry Estimation for Robot Scene Understanding (Cashier et al. 2012) t SLAM.txt

Live dense reconstruction with a single moving camera (2010) t SLAM.txt
 - Very good surface reconstruction method from Newcombe with applications to 3D Mapping

A system for reconstruction from point clouds in 3D: Simplification and mesh representation (Alboul and Chilveros 2010) t
 Centre for Automation and Robotics Research, MERI Sheffield Hallam University - Lyuba Alboul and Georgios Chliveros
- Sensors: CCD webcam and Laser 
- Data is fused into an RGBD format. Just like the kinect
- The data is then used to create a mesh by simply connecting the neighbors since the input is a structured data set.
- The mesh is then simplified by removing vertices with the lowest cost. 
- They have no methodology to adapt the mesh to new information

Automatic construction of polygonal maps from point cloud data (Wiemann et al. 2010) t
 University of Osnabruck, Germany - Thomas Wiemann, Andres Nuchter, Kai Lingemann, Stefan Stiene, Joaachim Hertzberg
- Their method constructs a polygonal mesh as a post processing step. 
- First all points clouds are registered with ICP and loop closing techniques 
- Then a mesh is created via marching cubes
- Finally, the mesh is optimized by merging planar surfaces
- Primary application is for building a map for a robot to localize in

ProFORMA: Probabilistic Feature-based On-line Rapid Model Acquisition (Pan et al. 2009) t
 Cambridge University - Qi Pan, Gerhard Reitmayr, Tom Drummond
- A real-time mesh based surface reconstruction using sparse visual features. This paper has a very impressive youtube video and is referenced by Newcombe
- Made for single object surface reconstruction. Relies on Delaunay triangulation and so can't be used for 3D Mapping
- "A point cloud in itself is not a good enough representation of an object, so processing is required to retrieve the model surface. There are many methods of achieving this, of which two effective ones are volumetric graph cuts [14] and space carving [16]."
- [14] - Multi-camera scene reconstruction via graph cuts (2002)
- [16] - A theory of shape by space carving (2000)
- So it sounds like carving might be related to visibility 

On fast surface reconstruction methods for large and noisy datasets (Marton et al. 2009) t
 Technische Universitat Munchen - Zoltan Marton, Radu Rusu, Michael Beetz
- They use a 2D laser on a robotic arm to acquire data.
- They claim many features of their method which are very similar to my goals. Namely: adaptability to variable densities, near realtime performance, noise robustness, memory efficiency, fast updates for incremental scans, and supporting point labels. 
- The problem: incorporating new points where there is already an existing mesh. "To solve this problem, our method triangulates only the new vertices which influence a change into the existing mesh." They never explain how they determine this influence  
- They use resampling of the underlying surface to reproduce uniform sampling where needed and control the vertex density of the mesh. By doing this, they can have dense vertices in regions of high curvature. 
- They heavily reference:
- Interpolation and approximation of surfaces from three-dimensional scattered data points (Mencl and Müller 1997) t
- A Fast and Efficient Projection-Based Approach for Surface Reconstruction (Gopi and Krishnan 2002) t
- Triangulating point set surfaces with bounded error (Scheidegger et al. 2005) t

Non-rigid registration of 3D surfaces by deformable 2D triangular meshes (Savran and Sankur 2008) t
 Bogazici University - Istanbul, Turkey - Arman Savran, Bulent Sankur
- Main motivation is the dynamic tracking and registering of meshes for human faces
- "We present a new automatic surface registration method which utilizes both attraction forces originating from geometrical and textural similarities, and stresses due to non-linear elasticity of the surfaces. Reference and target surfaces are first mapped onto their feature image planes, then these images are registered by subjecting them to local deformations, and finally 3D correspondences are established. Surfaces are assumed to be elastic sheets and are represented by triangular meshes. The internal elastic forces act as a regularizer in this ill-posed problem."
- Requires solving an energy minimization problem based on matching discrepancy in the photos
- Initialization is done with Delaunay triangulation via CGAL
- Registration starts from the coarsest level, and estimated deformations are subsequently transferred to a finer level. The deformation transfer from one mesh to another is realized by barycentric mapping. For each node of a finer level, its barycentric coordinates at the coarser mesh are calculated, and thus mapping of that node is obtained by a weighted sum of the previous mesh node values. 
- Runtime about ~7 seconds. Can't deal with changes in topology such as an open mouth

Temporal Surface Tracking using Mesh Evolution (Varanasi et al. 2008) t
 INRIA - Kiran Varanasi, Andrei Zaharescu, Edmond Boyer, Radu Horaud
- "In this paper, we address the problem of surface tracking in multiple camera environments and over time sequences. In order to fully track a surface undergoing significant deformations, we cast the problem as a mesh evolution over time. Such an evolution is driven by 3D displacement fields estimated between meshes recovered independently at different time frames."
- Sensor: Multiple camera environment 
- Motivation: Tracking human bodies in video sequences 
- Requires determining dense points with visual features and finding the correspondence. Something I don't want to rely on in my framework 
- Sparse matches are found with visual features
- The matches define a sparse displacement field which is propagated over all vertices by Laplacian diffusion 
- They have a data set where people are dancing. Would be a very challenging validation of my method
- They use visual hull reconstruction with 8 cameras to initialize the mesh
- Non real-time. Performed a validation with a simulated environment of 16 cameras 

Accurate multi-view reconstruction using robust binocular stereo and surface meshing (Bradley et al. 2008) t
 University of British Columbia - Derek Bradley, Wolfgang Heidrich
 TU Berlin - Tamy Boubekeur
- "In this paper, we have introduced a novel multiview stereo algorithm based on merging binocular depth maps with a state-of-the-art meshing algorithm. By employing an efficient, yet high-quality point-based processing pipeline, we are able to effectively remove outliers and suppress high-frequency noise."
- Point clouds are merged first and then meshed. Also, they require object segmentation as a pre-processing step
- After the point cloud is constructed the downsample and clean before meshing
- The split their point cloud into clusters using a density driven octree. In each cluster a Delaunay triangulation is performed on the points. The mesh patches are then merged into one mesh
- Method is not real-time, doesn't provide a way to adapt a mesh 

Transformesh: a topology-adaptive mesh-based approach to surface evolution (Zaharescu et al. 2007) t
 INRIA - Andrei Zaharescu, Edmond Boyer, Radu Horaud
-  "Most of the algorithms dealing with image based 3D reconstruction involve the evolution of a surface based on a minimization criterion. The mesh parametrization, while allowing for an accurate surface representation, suffers from the inherent problems of not being able to reliably deal with self intersections and topology changes.As a consequence, an important number of methods choose implicit representations of surfaces, e.g. level set methods, that naturally handle topology changes and intersections. Nevertheless, these methods rely on space discretizations, which introduce an unwanted precision-complexity trade-off. In this paper we explore a new mesh-based solution that robustly han- dles topology changes and removes self intersections, therefore overcoming the traditional limitations of this type of approaches"
- "Our contribution with respect to these methods is to provide a purely mesh based solution that does not constrain meshes and allows faces of all sizes as well as topology changes, with the goal of increasing precision without sacrificing complexity when dealing with surface evolution problems."
- "In essence, the approach preserves the mesh consistency by detecting self-intersections and considering the subset of the original mesh surface that is outside with respect to the mesh orientation."
- "We have presented a fully geometric efficient Lagrangian solution for triangular mesh evolutions able to handle topology changes gracefully. We have tested our method in the context of multi-view stereo 3-D reconstruction and we have obtained top ranking results, comparable with state-of-the-art methods in the literature. Our contribution with respect to the existing methods is to provide a purely geometric mesh-based solution that does not constrain meshes and that allows for facets of all sizes as well as for topology changes."
- Very beautiful work. They have to do an intersection check on their whole mesh though. They use bounding boxes to speed the process up
- They use region growing to decide which triangles need to be removed 
- They evolve their mesh using an energy equation based on image gradients 
- The check for self intersection on a mesh with 50,000 facets takes ~1 second

Real-Time Visibility-Based Fusion of Depth Maps (Merrell et al. 2007) t 
 University of North Carolina and University of Kentucky - 8 authors - Merrell et al.
- Well known and cited by Newcombe 2010 as a method to fuse several noisy depth maps into a mesh in real-time
- Has many of the same authors and university as "Detailed real-time urban 3D reconstruction from video (Pollefeys et al. 2007) t" which was also referenced by Newcombe
- "We advocate a two-stage process in which the first stage generates potentially noisy, overlapping depth maps from a set of calibrated images and the second stage fuses these depth maps to obtain an integrated surface with higher accuracy, suppressed noise, and reduced redundancy."
- Same figures and methodology as their prior work

Incremental Mesh-based Integration of Registered Range Images: Robust to Registration Error and Scanning Noise (Zhou et al. 2006) t
 University of Wales - Hong Zhou, Yonghuai Liu, 
 Texas A and M University - Longzhuang Li

Triangulating point set surfaces with bounded error (Scheidegger et al. 2005) t
 University of Utah - Carlos Sceidegger, Shachar Fleishman, Claudio Silvia
- "We introduce an algorithm for constructing a high-quality triangulation directly from Point Set Surfaces."
- Says that techniques up until now need expensive pre and post processing steps
- "The algorithm couples the machinery of MLS with the idea of advancing fronts."
- Very good related works section
- "Our algorithm takes as input a set of points P without normals and produces a high quality triangle mesh."
- It starts with a seed triangle whose edges define a "front" that is incrementally extended by two types of local operations. A triangle growing operation which adds a face which shares a common edge with the front and a ear-cut operation which adds two faces when there is three adjacent triangles on the front.
- "We use the moving least-squares (MLS) technique for specifying the underlying surface, and triangulate it to within a user-defined resolution."
- New vertices are added in 2 steps. A vertex position is first estimated using a vertex prediction operator. The vertex is then project onto the MLS surface. The vertex prediction considers the current edge length and the maximum curvature in the triangle neighborhood.
- They use a guidance field L() to drive their adaptive topology. The guidance field is the curvature of the MLS surface at that point. 
- They sample L() with a certain search distance.
- Still far from real-time, can't handle sharp corners because they can't be represented with MLS surfaces

- They have a different goal then I want. 
- Given a set of images and full information on intrinsic and extrinsic parameters, they want to infer the depth and color of the 3D point that the pixel is seeing.
- "The model we use to represent the scene consists of a set of colored depth maps."
- Extremely probabilistic method which requires lots of priors and an optimization scheme
- Needs a good initialization

 Tel Aviv University - Daniel Cohen-Or, Shachar Fleishman, David Levin
 AT&T Labs - Claudio Silva

A flexible framework for learning-based Surface Reconstruction (Saleem 2004) t
 Max-Planck-Institut fur Informatik - Waqar Saleem
- Saleem's thesis. His method uses Neural Networks to make a mesh-based surface reconstruction 
- Gives a good review of physics-based and deformable-model techniques 
- "Each vertex in M has an associated real function called a signal counter which is initialized with zero. For each sample, the closest vertex in M is found. This vertex is called the winner. It is moved some distance toward the sample, its 1-ring neighbourhood is smoothed and its signal counter is incremented. A vertex’s signal counter is thus a measure of its activity."
- Results work well for single object reconstruction

Level Set Methods and Dynamic Implicit Surfaces (Osher and Fedkiw 2003) t

- This implies spatial subdivision 

A multi-scale approach to 3D scattered data interpolation with compactly supported basis functions (2003) t 
 Max-Planck-Institut fur Informatik - Yutaka Ohtake, Alexander Belyaev, Hans-Peter Seidel
- Referenced by "Live dense reconstruction with a single moving camera (Newcombe et al. 2010) SLAM.txt" as the method used for creating an implicit function from their input sparse point cloud
- Seems to be the state-of-the-art in quickly determining the implicit function of a noisy point cloud 
- Of course, requires spatial subdivision and so shouldn't be appropriate for large scale 3D Mapping 

Bayesian stochastic mesh optimisation for 3D reconstruction (Ohtake et al. 2003) t
 University of Cambridge - George Vogiatzis, Roberto Cipolla
 Microsoft Research - Philip Torr
- "The input to the algorithm is a small set of images, sparse noisy feature correspondences (such as those provided by a Harris corner detector and cross correlation) and the camera geometry plus calibration. The output is a 3D mesh, that when projected onto each view, is visually consistent with the images."
- Optimization with simulated annealing. They tailor their proposal distribution for structure from motion
- The proposal distribution allow such things as vertex splitting and edge collapsing 
- Still takes ~10 min to process data and also requires an initial guess

Using growing cell structures for surface reconstruction (Ivrissimtzis et al. 2003) t
 Max-Plank-Institut fur Informatik - Saarbrucken, Germany - I.P. Ivrissimtzis, W.K. Jeong, H.P. Seidel
- first to introduce Neural Meshes  
- A mesh is adapted to a point sampling from a point cloud. The closest vertex is moved by a linear combination of the sample and it. 
- The vertices around the moved vertice is smoothed by calculating the Laplacian. This type of smoothing maybe important to me later. It is described well in this paper
- They use vertex split and edge collapse 
- Speed is a problem, however this has many common ideas with what I was thinking 

A geometric-based convection approach of 3D reconstruction (Chaine 2003) t
 Inventeurs du monde numérique (INRIA) - Raphaelle Chaine
- Their summation of related literature on "the reconstruction problem" would be a good framework

Mesh-independent surface interpolation (Levin 2003) t
 Tel Aviv University, Israel - David Levin
- Good reference for Moving Least-Squares (MLS) applied to surface reconstruction

Surface reconstruction by wrapping finite point sets in space (Edelsbrunner 2003) t
 University of Illinois - Herbert Edelsbrunner - also did Three-Dimensional Alpha Shapes (1994) t
- The mathematics on this paper is complex
- "In particular, we construct subcomplexes of the Delaunay complex of a finite point set by collapsing and occasionally deleting simplices. Continuous mathematics enters in the form of Morse functions and their gradient fields, which constitute the rationale for the rules that decide when to collapse and when not."

Fast Depth-Image Meshing and Warping (Pajarola et al. 2002) t
 University of California - Renato Pajarola, Yu Meng, Miguel Sainz
- Referenced by "Detailed Real-Time Urban 3D Reconstruction from Video (Pollefeys et al. 2007)" as the method for mesh generation from fused depth images
- We presented an efficient depth-image meshing and segmentation method as well as a novel real-time depth-image blending algorithm that exploits hardware accelerated graphics cards."
- Mesh doesn't seem to be a global representation. Seems to create a 2.5d mesh from novel views 
- "The main limitations of the presented method are the limited ability to cover exposure artifacts in comparison to layered approaches [SGHS98, DSSD99], and the exponential increase in rendering cost with respect to the number of blended reference views."

Stochastic Mesh-Based Multiview Reconstruction (Isidoro and Sclaroff 2002) t
 Boston University - John Isidoro, Stan Sclaroff
- Use a probabilistic method to find a surface that is photometrically consistent to set of images
- "Given a set of views and segmentation of the object in each view, constructive solid geometry is used to build a visual hull from silhouette prisms. The resulting polygonal mesh is simplified and subdivided to produce a semi-regular mesh. Regions of model fit inaccuracy are found by projecting the reference images onto the mesh from different views. The resulting error images for each view are used to compute a probability density function, and several points are sampled from it."

3D reconstruction of indoor and outdoor scenes using a mobile range scanner (Sun et al. 2002) t
 University of Tennessee - Y. Sun, J. K. Paik, A. Koschan, M. A. Abidi
- "In the raw range data preprocessing stage, we propose to use are decreasing flow for surface mesh smoothing instead of the mean curvature flow."
- "The are decreasing flow is proposed for surface mesh smoothing." Meaning they use a calculation based on the normal to adjust the vertice locations. 
- Was not real-time and did not give a way to modify the already created mesh
- Sensor: laser scanner

Surface reconstruction based on a dynamical system (Giesen and John 2002) t
 Institut fur Theoretische Informatik - Zurich, Switzerland - Joachim Giesen, Matthias John
- An interesting work. Very good quality. The reconstructions are good but are definitely not real time.
- Uses the Delaunay algorithm. Then defines a dynamical system based on some sort of flow functional on the surface. This functional is related to the distance function between the points.
- I believe then that some of the vertices are moved based on this flow functional. 
- States that surface reconstruction can be described in two categories. Implicit, which usually contains a signed distance function and an extracted surface which is then triangulated. Explicit, where a triangular mesh is computed directly.

Nothing is assumed about the geometry or topology of the sampled manifold model, except for its reasonable smoothness."
- "Surface reconstruction is a well studied problem in computer graphics and computational geometry community and has wide ranging applications."
- The state the "implicit function theorem of smooth surfaces" basically saying that the points in the neighborhood of a point can be projected onto the tangent plane of that point and be represented by a height function
- Their contributions are asymptotic performance, speed, and memory efficiency 
- Previous work in the reconstruction algorithms field. They categorize as surface-based schemes and volume-based schemes

Reconstruction and Representation of 3D Objects with Radial Basis Functions (Carr et al. 2001) t
 Applied Research Associates NZ Ltd - J.C. Carr, J.B. Cherrie, T.J. Mitchell, W.R. Fright, B.C. McCallum, T.R. Evans
 University of Canterbury - R.K. Beatson
- Highly referenced work for Surface Reconstruction using radial basis functions
- "We use polyharmonic Radial Basis Functions (RBFs) to reconstruct smooth, manifold surfaces from point-cloud data and to repair incomplete meshes. An object’s surface is defined implicitly as the zero set of an RBF fitted to the given surface data."
- "The functional representation is in effect a solid model, which means that gradients and surface normals can be determined analytically." - uniform meshes are then generated from this 
- Their methods consists of three steps
- 1 Constructing a signed-distance function
- 2 Fitting an RBF to the resulting distance function
- 3 Iso-surfacing the fitted RBF
- Main argument is the the space has to be discretized which is bad for environmental mapping applications. Beautiful work though, very good results, not real-time at all

Image-based multiresolution shape recovery by surface deformation (Zhang and Seitz 2000) t
 University of Washington - Li Zhang; Steven Seitz
- "The mesh is obtained by deforming a generic initial mesh such as a sphere or cube according to image and geometry-based forces."
- Input is a set of images 
- They project the mesh back onto the image and define an error metric which describes the error
- For a very small synthetic cube it took ~5 min
- Very good example of how the idea of deforming a mesh to the data has been studied for a long time

Mesh-based integration of range and color images (Sun et al. 2000) t
 University of Tennessee, Knoxville - Yiyong Sun, Christophe Dumont, Mongi Abidi
- Here range data is iteratively added to a global mesh model. 
- When an overlap is detected the most reliable triangles are kept. Reliability is determined by the senor pose from which the triangles were measured from. Only the most confidently acquired measurements are kept
- Detection of overlapping regions is done by projecting the mesh back onto the image plane
- They link gaps between mesh patches to "zipper" together mesh patches

Implicit nonparametric shape reconstruction from unorganized points using a variational level set method (Zhao et al. 2000) t
 University of California - Hong-Kai Zhao, Stanely Osher, Barry Merriman, Myungjoo Kang

- They solve their energy function using a PDE grid. Basically a mesh. 

Representation, shape, topology and evolution of deformable surfaces. Application to 3D medical image segmentation (Montagnat et al. 2000) t
 INRIA - Johan Montagnat, Herve Delingette, Nicolas Scapel, Nicholas Ayache
- A very large survey on deformable models. Complete with a taxonomy of available methods. With a concentration on simplex meshes
- "Deformable models were introduced by Kass et al in 2D as explicit deformable contours [60] and generalized to the 3D case by Terzopoulos et al [120]."
- [60] - Active contour models (1988)
- [120] - Constraints on Deformable Models: Recovering 3D Shape and Nonrigid Motion (1988)
- Does a good job of simply describing the various representations available 
- Describe the generic construction of the energy equation found in methods which find the minimum of an energy equation
- The energy of a deformable model is composed of several terms including at least an intrinsic regularizing term E_reg and a data term E_ext
- The energy functional is built such that its global minimum coincide with the expected solution S_o.
- The energy function needs to be discretized and an iterative optimization scheme applied to it 
- "The most common method is to rewrite this equation as a stationary equation corresponding to a force equilibrium. The equilibrium equation is then discretized using finite differences. Other resolution methods exist such as dynamic programming [3], greedy [128] algorithms or simulated annealing [94,107]."
- "Ad-hoc internal forces f_int that enforce some regularizing constraints and external forces f_ext that steer the surface deformations towards the data might be computed without considering any energy terms [43]."
- "A gradient descent or one of its derived algorithms [95,72] allow the minimization of a function as a model energy."
- Newton and Levenberg-Marquardt have been used as gradient descent procedures 
- "The evolutive approach consider the deformable model as a dynamic object evolving according to a parameter t [116]." - what I'm interested in. It can either evolve by Lagrangian equations of motion of Newtonian
- "A discrete model geometry is defined only at its vertices. Model deformations are not governed by a partial differential equation but by the model vertex displacements compared to its neighbors." - now this is exactly what I first envisioned 
- "To automatically determine topology changes in a noisy image without prior shape information may be unstable."
- Not only a survey. They present novel work which uses simplexes. 
- The difference between simplexes and triangulation is that the number of connection at each vertex is fixed for simplexes. I'm not sure what advantages this offers. What I do know is that simplexes seemed to be more popular in the beginning and now everyone uses triangulation

The ball-pivoting algorithm for surface reconstruction (Bernardini et al. 1999) t
 IBM Watson Research Center and AT&T Labs - Fausto Bernardini, Joshua Mittleman, Holly Rushmeier, Claudio Silva, Gabriel Taubin
- The concept is pretty simple "Three points form a triangle if a ball of a user-specified radius touches them without containing any other point. Starting with a seed triangle, the ball pivots around an edge until it touches another point, forming another triangle."
- It never throws away a point so not what I'm imagining

A shrink wrapping approach to remeshing polygonal surfaces (Kobbelt et al. 1999) t
 Max-Planck-Institut, Germany - Leif Kobbelt, Jens Vorsatz, Ulf Labsik, Hans-Peter Seidel
- They want to create a series of meshes with subdivision connectivity from a given unstructered triangle mesh
- The idea behind this is that the base mesh is very coarse but captures the rough shape of the object. Each iteration gives a mesh that has more detail and has the same connectivity for corresponding nodes. 
- Every iteration consists of an adaption and relaxiation step. The don't talk much about the adaptation step, but a virtual force is created with a vector from the current mesh to the intersection with the data. They claim to use ray-tracing to perform this
- Results look very good. Definitely not real time. I think it would also only work for objects

They combine the samples into a continuous volumetric function, computed and stored on a voxel grid. A subsequent hole-filling step also uses problem-specific information. Their implementation is especially fast and robust, capable of handling very large data sets." - A New Voronoi-Based Surface Reconstruction Algorithm

Disjoint regions are defined by finding areas of overlap of different subsets of the set of scans. Estimated surface points for each region are computed as weighted averages of points from the overlapping scans. Estimated points in each region are then re-triangulated, and the resulting meshes are stitched into a single mesh." - The ball-pivoting algorithm for surface reconstruction (1999)

- 15 pg long paper. They do a good job of laying out their method and show simple examples 
- Their approach is dynamic and can deal with 4d data. Specifically to capture the movement of arteries and such
- Uses an inflation force, meaning the it can only deal with closed models and is best suited for single object reconstruction
- They update the position of the nodes exactly how I intended to

- "The surface-descriptions of several different sensors may overlap. In these regions an algorithm should produce a consistent representation of the surface. The accuracy of the different sensors should be taken into account for this task." 
- It seems they create a probability for each measurement using a sensor model which uses the normal of the surface.

Surface reconstruction from unorganized points (Hoppe et al. 1992) t
 University of Washington - Hugues Hoppe, Tony DeRose, Tom Duchamp, John McDonald, Werner Stuetzle 
- Categorized as spatial-subdivision , surface-oriented cell selection in Mencl and Muller (1997) also they said it is based on SDF
- Highly referenced work. Probably due to it's simplicity. Implicit method 
- It does not appear to be real time
- It is better than previous implicit methods because it deals with boundaries in a natural way
- It is better than parametric methods because it can reconstruct surfaces of arbitrary topology
- Basically estimates the zero set of an estimated signed distance function
- "A fundamentally different approach to reconstruction is to use the input points to define a signed distance function on R3, and then polygonalize its zero-set to create the output mesh. Such zero set algorithms produce approximating, rather than interpolating, meshes." - A New Voronoi-Based Surface Reconstruction Algorithm
- "Hoppe et al. determine an approximate tangent plane at each sample point using least squares on k nearest neighbors, and then take the signed distance to the nearest point’s tangent plane as the distance function on R3 . The distance function is then interpolated and polygonalized by the marching cubes algorithm." - A New Voronoi-Based Surface Reconstruction Algorithm

- "In this paper we propose shape models that may be viewed as deformable bodies composed of simulated elastic material." 
- User must initialize a spline along the axis of the object.
- A mesh tube then expands or contracts around this spline to fit the object
- The movement of the mesh is governed by simulating an elastic material. 
- They application is reconstructing objects from a singular monocular image
- Their force is created by computing the image-intensity gradient

Elastically deformable models (Terzopoulos et al. 1987) t
 Palo Alto Research and California Institute of Technology - Demetri Terzopoulos, John Platt, Alan Barr, Kurt Fleischer
- Very well known work, highly referenced. 
- Not really about an adaptive mesh, but one of the first works to use a physics based discretization for simulation
- Intended for CGI applications

Marching cubes: A high resolution 3D surface construction algorithm (Loresen and Cline 1987) t
 General Electric Company - William Loresen, Harvey Cline
 - Known to be a slow but very reliable algorithm
 - Essentially places a cube at each point in the data and uses the gradient of the data to determine if vertices should be placed. If they are placed they are placed along the edges or at the corners of the cube. 
 - "The algorithm uses a case table of edge intersections to describe how a surface cuts through each cube in a 3D data set."
 - This work was developed for medical imaging 
 - Not sure how it works with point cloud data but it is cited quite often

Regularization of inverse visual problems involving discontinuities (Terzopoulos 1986) t
 Schlumberger Palo Alto Research; CA - Demetri Terzopoulos 
- Figured out how to deal with discontinuities when dealing with splines
- Not sure the data type
- "A broad range of visual reconstruction problems may be unified mathematically as well-posed variational principles which characterize optimal approximation problems involving a class of generalized multidimensional spline functionals."
- Extremely mathematically intense paper
- Approach is inappropriate for real-time applications

Geometric structures for three-dimensional shape representation (Boissonnat 1984) t
 INRIA - Jean-Daniel Boissonnat
- Categorized as spatial subdivision / volume-oriented cell selection in Mencl and Muller (1997) also as incremental surface
- They present a surface and volume based method 
- The surface based approach project the neighborhood around a point onto a tangent plane then triangulation is done by Delaunay
- The volume based approach seems to just be the 3d Delaunay triangulation 
- Like all early papers, this gives a simple explanation of some of the basic concepts in reconstruction. Here Delaunay triangulation
- "Boissonnat's surface contouring algorithm starts with an edge and iteratively attaches further triangles at boundary edges of the emerging surface using a projection-based approach to generate manifolds without boundaries." - A fast and efficient projection-based approach for surface reconstruction (2002)

Mesh Denoising Using Quadric Error Metric (2010)
 Universidade de Ciencias Exatas - Montes Claros, Brazil - Antonio Vieira
 UFMG - Belo Horizonte, Brazil - Armando Neto, Douglas Macharet, Mario Campos
- Method for mesh denoising with an operator based on the Quadric Error Metric
- Prior denoising methods remove high frequency noise at the cost of removing sharp features
- "A known property of the QEM is that, given a pont whose neighborhood is defined by a set of two or more planes, it is able to adjust this point so it best fits to all planes."
- Because the vertex is moved to a point which minimizes the distance to a set of planes high frequency information can be preserved

Laplacian mesh optimization (2006)
 TU Berlin - Andrew Nealen, Olga Sorkine, Marc Alexa
 University of Tokyo - Takeo Igarashi
- "We introduce a framework for triangle shape optimization and feature preserving smoothing of triangular meshes that is guided by the vertex Laplacians, specifically, the uniformly weighted Laplacian and the discrete mean curvature normal."
- A methodology to move the surface vertices in order to smooth the mesh
- Shows the results using constant weights, linear weights, and cdf weights

3D Compression Made Simple : Edgebreaker on a Corner-Table Notation and Corner-Table (2001)
 Georgia Institute of Technology - Jarek Rossignac, Alla Safonova, Andrzej Szymczak 
- Referenced as the beginning of the Corner-Table method
- The claim is that the Corner-Table is a simple technique for compressing 3D triangular meshes
- It is supposed to be a much less complex way to represent the connectivity compared to prior methods 

Surface simplification using quadric error metrics (1997) t
 Carnegie Mellon - Michael Garland, Paul Heckbert
- surface simplification done by contractions of vertex pairs
- maintains surface error approximations using quadric matrices
- vertex contraction consists of combining 2 or more vertices into a single vertex
- quadric is used to measure the distance of a point to a set of planes
- the metric is designed so that the simplification doesn't drive the new model too far from the original in a geometric sense

"In recent years the use of implicit surfaces and volumetric methods has attracted much attention [5, 8, 15, 18, 19]. In these approaches a scalar field function is constructed on a fixed grid and the final shape is a particular level set of the field function. Usually the scalar function is the signed distance to the final shape. Implicit representations usually have topological flexibility, a simple data structure, and depth/volumetric information"
