abstract = {This paper presents Kinect Monte Carlo Localization (KMCL), a new method for localization in three dimensional indoor environments using RGB-D cameras, such as the Microsoft Kinect. The approach makes use of a low fidelity a priori 3-D model of the area of operation composed of large planar segments, such as walls and ceilings, which are assumed to remain static. Using this map as input, the KMCL algorithm employs feature-based visual odometry as the particle propagation mechanism and utilizes the 3-D map and the underlying sensor image formation model to efficiently simulate RGB-D camera views at the location of particle poses, using a graphical processing unit (GPU). The generated 3D views of the scene are then used to evaluate the likelihood of the particle poses. This GPU implementation provides a factor of ten speedup over a pure distance-based method, yet provides comparable accuracy. Experimental results are presented for five different configurations, including: (1) a robotic wheelchair, (2) a sensor mounted on a person, (3) an Ascending Technologies quadrotor, (4) a Willow Garage PR2, and (5) an RWI B21 wheeled mobile robot platform. The results demonstrate that the system can perform robust localization with 3D information for motions as fast as 1.5 meters per second. The approach is designed to be applicable not just for robotics but other applications such as wearable computing.},

abstract = {RGB-D cameras are novel sensing systems that capture RGB images along with per-pixel depth information. In this paper we investigate how such cameras can be used in the context of robotics, speciﬁcally for building dense 3D maps of indoor environments. Such maps have applications in robot navigation, manipulation, semantic mapping, and telepresence. We present RGB-D Mapping, a full 3D mapping system that utilizes a novel joint optimization algorithm combining visual features and shape-based alignment. Visual and depth information are also combined for view-based loop closure detection, followed by pose optimization to achieve globally consistent maps.We evaluate RGB-DMapping on two large indoor environments, and show that it effectively combines the visual and shape information available from RGB-D cameras.},

abstract = {The number of registration solutions in the literature has bloomed recently. The iterative closest point, for example, could be considered as the backbone of many laser-based localization and mapping systems. Although they are widely used, it is a common challenge to compare registration solutions on a fair base. The main limitation is to overcome the lack of accurate ground truth in current data sets, which usually cover environments only over a small range of organization levels. In computer vision, the Stanford 3D Scanning Repository pushed forward point cloud registration algorithms and object modeling fields by providing high-quality scanned objects with precise localization. We aim to provide similar high-caliber working material to the robotic and computer vision communities but with sceneries instead of objects. We propose eight point cloud sequences acquired in locations covering the environment diversity that modern robots are susceptible to encounter, ranging from inside an apartment to a woodland area. The core of the data sets consists of 3D laser point clouds for which supporting data (Gravity, Magnetic North and GPS) are given for each pose. A special effort has been made to ensure global positioning of the scanner within mm-range precision, independent of environmental conditions. This will allow for the development of improved registration algorithms when mapping challenging environments, such as those found in real-world situations.1},

abstract = {Bundle adjustment (BA) which produces highly accurate results for visual Simultaneous Localization and Map ping (SLAM) could not be used for Micro-Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) with limited processing power because of its O(N3) complexity. We observed that a consistent ground plane often exists for MAVs flying in both the indoor and outdoor urban environments. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a visual SLAM algorithm that make use of the plane constraint to reduce the complexity of BA. The reduction of complexity is achieved by refining only the current camera pose and most recent map points with BA that minimizes the reprojection errors and perpendicular distances between the most recent map points and the best fit plane with all the pre-existing map points. As a result, our algorithm is approximately constant time since the number of current camera pose and most recent map points remain approximately constant. In addition, the minimization of the perpendicular distances between the plane and map points would enforce consistency between the reconstructed map points and the actual ground plane.},

abstract = {We present an energy-based approach to visual odometry from RGB-D images of a Microsoft Kinect camera. To this end we propose an energy function which aims at finding the best rigid body motion to map one RGB-D image into another one, assuming a static scene filmed by a moving camera. We then propose a linearization of the energy function which leads to a 6{\&}{\#}x00D7;6 normal equation for the twist coordinates representing the rigid body motion. To allow for larger motions, we solve this equation in a coarse-to-fine scheme. Extensive quantitative analysis on recently proposed benchmark datasets shows that the proposed solution is faster than a state-of-the-art implementation of the iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm by two orders of magnitude. While ICP is more robust to large camera motion, the proposed method gives better results in the regime of small displacements which are often the case in camera tracking applications.},

In this paper we present a technique that performs generalized ICP on two frames in typical times of 10 ms.

@article{Pathak2010,
abstract = {We present a robot-pose-registration algorithm, which is entirely based on large planar-surface patches extracted from point clouds sampled from a three-dimensional (3-D) sensor. This approach offers an alternative to the traditional point-to-point iterative-closest-point (ICP) algorithm, its point-to-plane variant, as well as newer grid-based algorithms, such as the 3-D normal distribution transform (NDT). The simpler case of known plane correspondences is tackled first by deriving expressions for least-squares pose estimation considering plane-parameter uncertainty computed during plane extraction. Closed-form expressions for covariances are also derived. To round-off the solution, we present a new algorithm, which is called minimally uncertain maximal consensus (MUMC), to determine the unknown plane correspondences by maximizing geometric consistency by minimizing the uncertainty volume in configuration space. Experimental results from three 3-D sensors, viz., Swiss-Ranger, University of South Florida Odetics Laser Detection and Ranging, and an actuated SICK S300, are given. The first two have low fields of view (FOV) and moderate ranges, while the third has a much bigger FOV and range. Experimental results show that this approach is not only more robust than point- or grid-based approaches in plane-rich environments, but it is also faster, requires significantly less memory, and offers a less-cluttered planar-patches-based visualization.},

abstract = {We present a method which enables rapid and dense reconstruction of scenes browsed by a single live camera. We take point-based real-time structure from motion (SFM) as our starting point, generating accurate 3D camera pose estimates and a sparse point cloud. Our main novel contribution is to use an approximate but smooth base mesh generated from the SFM to predict the view at a bundle of poses around automatically selected reference frames spanning the scene, and then warp the base mesh into highly accurate depth maps based on view-predictive optical flow and a constrained scene flow update. The quality of the resulting depth maps means that a convincing global scene model can be obtained simply by placing them side by side and removing overlapping regions. We show that a cluttered indoor environment can be reconstructed from a live hand-held camera in a few seconds, with all processing performed by current desktop hardware. Real-time monocular dense reconstruction opens up many application areas, and we demonstrate both real-time novel view synthesis and advanced augmented reality where augmentations interact physically with the 3D scene and are correctly clipped by occlusions.},

Our method results in a simple algorithm for mesh denoising that can also be used to enhance sharp features present in the surface corrupted by noise. A frequency response analysis is also presented in order to evaluate the characteristics of this operator in the frequency spectrum of the mesh.},

abstract = {We describe a new formulation of appearance-only SLAM suitable for very large scale place recognition. The system navigates in the space of appearance, assigning each new observation to either a new or a previously visited location, without reference to metric position. The system is demonstrated performing reliable online appearance mapping and loop-closure detection over a 1000 km trajectory, with mean filter update times of 14 ms. The scalability of the system is achieved by defining a sparse approximation to the FAB-MAP model suitable for implementation using an inverted index. Our formulation of the problem is fully probabilistic and naturally incorporates robustness against perceptual aliasing. We also demonstrate that the approach substantially outperforms the standard term-frequency inverse-document-frequency (tf-idf) ranking measure. The 1000 km data set comprising almost a terabyte of omni-directional and stereo imagery is available for use, and we hope that it will serve as a benchmark for future systems.},

However, the distance measurements of these devices are often affected by some systematic errors which decrease the quality of the acquired data. In order to evaluate these errors, some experimental tests on a CCD/CMOS ToF camera sensor, the SwissRanger (SR)-4000 camera, were performed and reported in this paper. In particular, two main aspects are treated: the calibration of the distance measurements of the SR-4000 camera, which deals with evaluation of the camera warm up time period, the distance measurement error evaluation and a study of the influence on distance measurements of the camera orientation with respect to the observed object; the second aspect concerns the photogrammetric calibration of the amplitude images delivered by the camera using a purpose-built multi-resolution field made of high contrast targets.},

abstract = {In this work, we utilize a recently studied more accurate range noise model for 3D sensors to derive from scratch the expressions for the optimum plane which best fits a point-cloud and for the combined covariance matrix of the plane's parameters. The parameters in question are the plane's normal and its distance to the origin. The range standard-deviation model used by us is a quadratic function of the true range and is a function of the incidence angle as well. We show that for this model, the maximum-likelihood plane is biased, whereas the least-squares plane is not. The plane-parameters' covariance matrix for the least-squares plane is shown to possess a number of desirable properties, e.g., the optimal solution forms its null-space and its components are functions of easily understood terms like the planar-patch's center and scatter. We verify our covariance expression with that obtained by the eigenvector perturbation method. We further compare our method to that of renormalization with respect to the theoretically best covariance matrix in simulation. The application of our approach to real-time range-image registration and plane fusion is shown by an example using a commercially available 3D range sensor. Results show that our method has good accuracy, is fast to compute, and is easy to interpret intuitively.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present incremental smoothing and mapping (iSAM), which is a novel approach to the simultaneous localization and mapping problem that is based on fast incremental matrix factorization. iSAM provides an efficient and exact solution by updating a QR factorization of the naturally sparse smoothing information matrix, thereby recalculating only those matrix entries that actually change. iSAM is efficient even for robot trajectories with many loops as it avoids unnecessary fill-in in the factor matrix by periodic variable reordering. Also, to enable data association in real time, we provide efficient algorithms to access the estimation uncertainties of interest based on the factored information matrix. We systematically evaluate the different components of iSAM as well as the overall algorithm using various simulated and real-world datasets for both landmark and pose-only settings.},

In this paper, we propose a framework for applying the same techniques to visual imagery. We match visual frames with large numbers of point features, using classic bundle adjustment techniques from computational vision, but we keep only relative frame pose information (a skeleton). The skeleton is a reduced nonlinear system that is a faithful approximation of the larger system and can be used to solve large loop closures quickly, as well as forming a backbone for data association and local registration. We illustrate the workings of the system with large outdoor datasets (10 km), showing large-scale loop closure and precise localization in real time.},

@article{Paz2008,
abstract = {In this paper, we describe a system that can carry out simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) in large indoor and outdoor environments using a stereo pair moving with 6 DOF as the only sensor. Unlike current visual SLAM systems that use either bearing-only monocular information or 3-D stereo information, our system accommodates both monocular and stereo. Textured point features are extracted from the images and stored as 3-D points if seen in both images with sufficient disparity, or stored as inverse depth points otherwise. This allows the system to map both near and far features: the first provide distance and orientation, and the second provide orientation information. Unlike other vision-only SLAM systems, stereo does not suffer from ldquoscale driftrdquo because of unobservability problems, and thus, no other information such as gyroscopes or accelerometers is required in our system. Our SLAM algorithm generates sequences of conditionally independent local maps that can share information related to the camera motion and common features being tracked. The system computes the full map using the novel conditionally independent divide and conquer algorithm, which allows constant time operation most of the time, with linear time updates to compute the full map. To demonstrate the robustness and scalability of our system, we show experimental results in indoor and outdoor urban environments of 210 m and 140 m loop trajectories, with the stereo camera being carried in hand by a person walking at normal walking speeds of 4--5 km/h.},

abstract = {A fast but nevertheless accurate approach for surface extraction from noisy 3D point clouds is presented. It consists of two parts, namely a plane fitting and a polygonalization step. Both exploit the sequential nature of 3D data acquisition on mobile robots in form of range images. For the plane fitting, this is used to revise the standard mathematical formulation to an incremental version, which allows a linear computation. For the polygonalization, the neighborhood relation in range images is exploited. Experiments are presented using a time-of-flight range camera in form of a Swissranger SR-3000. Results include lab scenes as well as data from two runs of the rescue robot league at the RoboCup German Open 2007 with 1,414, respectively 2,343 sensor snapshots. The 36ldr106, respectively 59ldr106 points from the two point clouds are reduced to about 14ldr103, respectively 23ldr103 planes with only about 0.2 sec of total computation time per snapshot while the robot moves along.

abstract = {This paper describes a probabilistic approach to the problem of recognizing places based on their appearance. The system we present is not limited to localization, but can determine that a new observation comes from a previously unseen place, and so augment its map. Effectively this is a SLAM system in the space of appearance. Our probabilistic approach allows us to explicitly account for perceptual aliasing in the environment--identical but indistinctive observations receive a low probability of having come from the same place. We achieve this by learning a generative model of place appearance. By partitioning the learning problem into two parts, new place models can be learned online from only a single observation of a place. The algorithm complexity is linear in the number of places in the map, and is particularly suitable for online loop closure detection in mobile robotics.},

While this has previously been attempted by adapting SLAM algorithms developed for robotic exploration, we propose a system specifically designed to track a hand-held camera in a small AR workspace. We propose to split tracking and mapping into two separate tasks, processed in parallel threads on a dual-core computer: one thread deals with the task of robustly tracking erratic hand-held motion, while the other produces a 3D map of point features from previously observed video frames. This allows the use of computationally expensive batch optimisation techniques not usually associated with real-time operation: The result is a system that produces detailed maps with thousands of landmarks which can be tracked at frame-rate, with an accuracy and robustness rivalling that of state-of-the-art model-based systems.},

abstract = {Robust integration of range images is an important task for building high-quality 3D models. Since range images, and in particular range maps from stereo vision, may have a substantial amount of outliers, any integration approach aiming at high-quality models needs an increased level of robustness. Additionally, a certain level of regularization is required to obtain smooth surfaces. Computational efficiency and global convergence are further preferable properties. The contribution of this paper is a unified framework to solve all these issues. Our method is based on minimizing an energy functional consisting of a total variation (TV) regularization force and an L1 data fidelity term. We present a novel and efficient numerical scheme, which combines the duality principle for the TV term with a point-wise optimization step. We demonstrate the superior performance of our algorithm on the well-known Middlebury multi-view database and additionally on real-world multi-view images.},

abstract = {Learning maps is one of the fundamental tasks of mobile robots. In the past, numerous efficient approaches to map learning have been proposed. Most of them, however, assume that the robot lives on a plane. In this paper, we consider the problem of learning maps with mobile robots that operate in non-flat environments and apply maximum likelihood techniques to solve the graph-based SLAM problem. Due to the non-commutativity of the rotational angles in 3D, major problems arise when applying approaches designed for the two-dimensional world. The non-commutativity introduces serious difficulties when distributing a rotational error over a sequence of poses. In this paper, we present an efficient solution to the SLAM problem that is able to distribute a rotational error over a sequence of nodes. Our approach applies a variant of gradient descent to solve the error minimization problem. We implemented our technique and tested it on large simulated and real world datasets. We furthermore compared our approach to solving the problem by LU-decomposition. As the experiments illustrate, our technique converges significantly faster to an accurate map with low error and is able to correct maps with bigger noise than existing methods.},

abstract = {We present a viewpoint-based approach for the quick fusion of multiple stereo depth maps. Our method selects depth estimates for each pixel that minimize violations of visibility constraints and thus remove errors and inconsistencies from the depth maps to produce a consistent surface. We advocate a two-stage process in which the first stage generates potentially noisy, overlapping depth maps from a set of calibrated images and the second stage fuses these depth maps to obtain an integrated surface with higher accuracy, suppressed noise, and reduced redundancy. We show that by dividing the processing into two stages we are able to achieve a very high throughput because we are able to use a computationally cheap stereo algorithm and because this architecture is amenable to hardware-accelerated (GPU) implementations. A rigorous formulation based on the notion of stability of a depth estimate is presented first. It aims to determine the validity of a depth estimate by rendering multiple depth maps into the reference view as well as rendering the reference depth map into the other views in order to detect occlusions and free- space violations. We also present an approximate alternative formulation that selects and validates only one hypothesis based on confidence. Both formulations enable us to perform video-based reconstruction at up to 25 frames per second. We show results on the multi-view stereo evaluation benchmark datasets and several outdoors video sequences. Extensive quantitative analysis is performed using an accurately surveyed model of a real building as ground truth.},

abstract = {Monocular SLAM has the potential to turn inexpensive cameras into powerful pose sensors for applications such as robotics and augmented reality. However, current implementations lack the robustness required to be useful outside laboratory conditions: blur, sudden motion and occlusion all cause tracking to fail and corrupt the map. Here we present a system which automatically detects and recovers from tracking failure while preserving map integrity. By extending recent advances in keypoint recognition the system can quickly resume tracking - i.e. within a single frame time of 33 ms - using any of the features previously stored in the map. Extensive tests show that the system can reliably generate maps for long sequences even in the presence of frequent tracking failure.},

abstract = {We present a real-time algorithm which can recover the 3D trajectory of a monocular camera, moving rapidly through a previously unknown scene. Our system, which we dub MonoSLAM, is the first successful application of the SLAM methodology from mobile robotics to the "pure vision" domain of a single uncontrolled camera, achieving real time but drift-free performance inaccessible to Structure from Motion approaches. The core of the approach is the online creation of a sparse but persistent map of natural landmarks within a probabilistic framework. Our key novel contributions include an active approach to mapping and measurement, the use of a general motion model for smooth camera movement, and solutions for monocular feature initialization and feature orientation estimation. Together, these add up to an extremely efficient and robust algorithm which runs at 30 Hz with standard PC and camera hardware. This work extends the range of robotic systems in which SLAM can be usefully applied, but also opens up new areas. We present applications of MonoSLAM to real-time 3D localization and mapping for a high-performance full-size humanoid robot and live augmented reality with a hand-held camera.},

By learning a generative model of appearance, we can compute not only the similarity of two observations, but also the probability that they originate from the same location, and hence compute a pdf over observer location. We do not limit ourselves to the kidnapped robot problem (localizing in a known map), but admit the possibility that observations may come from previously unvisited places. The principled probabilistic approach we develop allows us to explicitly account for the perceptual aliasing in the environment - identical but indistinctive observations receive a low probability of having come from the same place. Our algorithm complexity is linear in the number of places, and is particularly suitable for online loop closure detection in mobile robotics.},

abstract = {This paper describes a 3D SLAM system using information from an actuated laser scanner and camera installed on a mobile robot. The laser samples the local geometry of the environment and is used to incrementally build a 3D point-cloud map of the workspace. Sequences of images from the camera are used to detect loop closure events (without reference to the internal estimates of vehicle location) using a novel appearance-based retrieval system. The loop closure detection is robust to repetitive visual structure and provides a probabilistic measure of confidence. The images suggesting loop closure are then further processed with their corresponding local laser scans to yield putative Euclidean image-image transformations. We show how naive application of this transformation to effect the loop closure can lead to catastrophic linearization errors and go on to describe a way in which gross, pre-loop closing errors can be successfully annulled. We demonstrate our system working in a challenging, outdoor setting containing substantial loops and beguiling, gently curving traversals. The results are overlaid on an aerial image to provide a ground truth comparison with the estimated map. The paper concludes with an extension into the multi-robot domain in which 3D maps resulting from distinct SLAM sessions (no common reference frame) are combined without recourse to mutual observation},

We demonstrate that with a few augmentations, existing 2D SLAM technology can be extended to perform full 3D SLAM in less benign, outdoor, undulating environments. In particular, we use data acquired with a 3D laser range finder. We use a simple segmentation algorithm to separate the data stream into distinct point clouds, each referenced to a vehicle position. The SLAM technique we then adopt inherits much from 2D delayed state (or scan-matching) SLAM in that the state vector is an ever growing stack of past vehicle positions and inter-scan registrations are used to form measurements between them. The registration algorithm used is a novel combination of previous techniques carefully balancing the need for maximally wide convergence basins, robustness and speed. In addition, we introduce a novel post-registration classification technique to detect matches which have converged to incorrect local minima},

abstract = {Solving the SLAM (simultaneous localization and mapping) problem is one way to enable a robot to explore, map, and navigate in a previously unknown environment. Smoothing approaches have been investigated as a viable alternative to extended Kalman filter (EKF)-based solutions to the problem. In particular, approaches have been looked at that factorize either the associated information matrix or the measurement Jacobian into square root form. Such techniques have several significant advantages over the EKF: they are faster yet exact; they can be used in either batch or incremental mode; are better equipped to deal with non-linear process and measurement models; and yield the entire robot trajectory, at lower cost for a large class of SLAM problems. In addition, in an indirect but dramatic way, column ordering heuristics automatically exploit the locality inherent in the geographic nature of the SLAM problem. This paper presents the theory underlying these methods, along with an interpretation of factorization in terms of the graphical model associated with the SLAM problem. Both simulation results and actual SLAM experiments in large-scale environments are presented that underscore the potential of these methods as an alternative to EKF-based approaches.},

abstract = {A robot exploring an environment can estimate its own motion and the relative positions of features in the environment. Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithms attempt to fuse these estimates to produce a map and a robot trajectory. The constraints are generally non-linear, thus SLAM can be viewed as a non-linear optimization problem. The optimization can be difficult, due to poor initial estimates arising from odometry data, and due to the size of the state space. We present a fast non-linear optimization algorithm that rapidly recovers the robot trajectory, even when given a poor initial estimate. Our approach uses a variant of stochastic gradient descent on an alternative state-space representation that has good stability and computational properties. We compare our algorithm to several others, using both real and synthetic data sets},

abstract = {Integration and reconstruction of object surface model from range images captured from different viewpoints is a primitive problem for the application of laser scanning systems in reverse engineering and industrial inspection. Normally all these range images have to be first transformed into a global coordinate system, space divided algorithm is then employed to integrate and reconstruct the object surface model. But the final output cannot in general guarantee to be a single, smooth and water-tight surface due to large registration errors, noisy points and limited resolution of point sampling. In this paper, we propose a practical system for integrating registered range images from different views. The new method not only combines advantages of points based and mesh based integration such as flexibility and incremental property, but also fixes their shortcomings such as shape distortion, thick surface or difficult determination of grid size. It can also process both unstructured and structured points. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is effective and accurate for the integration of registered range images from multi-views with relatively large registration errors and heavy scanning noise.},

abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) by a mobile robot. An incremental SLAM algorithm is introduced that is derived from multigrid methods used for solving partial differential equations. The approach improves on the performance of previous relaxation methods for robot mapping, because it optimizes the map at multiple levels of resolution. The resulting algorithm has an update time that is linear in the number of estimated features for typical indoor environments, even when closing very large loops, and offers advantages in handling nonlinearities compared with other SLAM algorithms. Experimental comparisons with alternative algorithms using two well-known data sets and mapping results on a real robot are also presented.},

abstract = {This paper presents results from three experiments in which human operators were teamed with a mixed-initiative robot control system to accomplish various indoor search and exploration tasks. By assessing human workload and error together with overall performance, these experiments provide an objective means to contrast different modes of robot autonomy and to evaluate both the usability of the interface and the effectiveness of autonomous robot behavior. The first experiment compares the performance achieved when the robot takes initiative to support human driving with the opposite case when the human takes initiative to support autonomous robot driving. The utility of robot autonomy is shown through achievement of better performance when the robot is in the driver's seat. The second experiment introduces a virtual three-dimensional (3-D) map representation that supports collaborative understanding of the task and environment. When used in place of video, the 3-D map reduced operator workload and navigational error. By lowering bandwidth requirements, use of the virtual 3-D interface enables long-range, nonline-of-sight communication. Results from the third experiment extend the findings of experiment 1 by showing that collaborative control can increase performance and reduce error even when the complexity of the environment is increased and workload is distributed amongst multiple operators.},

This approach uses a particle filter in which each particle carries an individual map of the environment. Accordingly, a key question is how to reduce the number of particles. In this paper we present adaptive techniques to reduce the number of particles in a Rao-Blackwellized particle filter for learning grid maps. We propose an approach to compute an accurate proposal distribution taking into account not only the movement of the robot but also the most recent observation. This drastically decrease the uncertainty about the robot's pose in the prediction step of the filter. Furthermore, we present an approach to selectively carry out re-sampling operations which seriously reduces the problem of particle depletion. Experimental results carried out with mobile robots in large-scale indoor as well as in outdoor environments illustrate the advantages of our methods over previous approaches.},

abstract = {An efficient algorithmic solution to the classical five-point relative pose problem is presented. The problem is to find the possible solutions for relative camera pose between two calibrated views given five corresponding points. The algorithm consists of computing the coefficients of a tenth degree polynomial in closed form and, subsequently, finding its roots. It is the first algorithm well-suited for numerical implementation that also corresponds to the inherent complexity of the problem. We investigate the numerical precision of the algorithm. We also study its performance under noise in minimal as well as overdetermined cases. The performance is compared to that of the well-known 8 and 7-point methods and a 6-point scheme. The algorithm is used in a robust hypothesize-and-test framework to estimate structure and motion in real-time with low delay. The real-time system uses solely visual input and has been demonstrated at major conferences.},

One approach to SLAM assumes relatively sparse, relatively unambiguous landmarks and builds a Kalman filter over landmark positions. Other approaches assume dense sensor data which individually are not very distinctive, such as those available from a laser range finder. In earlier work, we presented an algorithm called DP-SLAM, which provided a very accurate solution to the latter case by efficiently maintaining a joint distribution over robot maps and poses. The approach assumed an extremely accurate laser range finder and a deterministic environment. In this work we demonstrate an improved map representation and laser penetration model, an improvement in the asymptotic efficiency of the algorithm, and empirical results of loop closing on a high resolution map of a very challenging domain.},

A particularly challenging problem in acquiring environment maps is that of closing loops; loops in the environment create challenging data association problems [J.-S. Gutman et al., 1999]. This paper presents a novel algorithm that combines Rao-Blackwellized particle filtering and scan matching. In our approach scan matching is used for minimizing odometric errors during mapping. A probabilistic model of the residual errors of scan matching process is then used for the resampling steps. This way the number of samples required is seriously reduced. Simultaneously we reduce the particle depletion problem that typically prevents the robot from closing large loops. We present extensive experiments that illustrate the superior performance of our approach compared to previous approaches.},

abstract = {Digital 3D models of the environment are needed in rescue and inspection robotics, facility managements and architecture. This paper presents an automatic system for gaging and digitalization of 3Dindoorenvironments. It consists of an autonomousmobilerobot, a reliable 3Dlaserrangefinder and three elaborated software modules. The first module, a fast variant of the Iterative Closest Points algorithm, registers the 3D scans in a common coordinate system and relocalizes the robot. The second module, a next best view planner, computes the next nominal pose based on the acquired 3D data while avoiding complicated obstacles. The third module, a closed-loop and globally stable motor controller, navigates the mobilerobot to a nominal pose on the base of odometry and avoids collisions with dynamical obstacles. The 3Dlaserrangefinder acquires a3D scan at this pose. The proposed method allows one to digitalize large indoorenvironments fast and reliably without any intervention and solves the SLAM problem. The results of two 3Ddigitalization experiments are presented using a fast octree-based visualization method.},

abstract = {The World Trade Center (WTC) rescue response provided an unfortunate opportunity to study the human-robot interactions (HRI) during a real unstaged rescue for the first time. A post-hoc analysis was performed on the data collected during the response, which resulted in 17 findings on the impact of the environment and conditions on the HRI: the skills displayed and needed by robots and humans, the details of the Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) task, the social informatics in the USAR domain, and what information is communicated at what time. The results of this work impact the field of robotics by providing a case study for HRI in USAR drawn from an unstaged USAR effort. Eleven recommendations are made based on the findings that impact the robotics, computer science, engineering, psychology, and rescue fields. These recommendations call for group organization and user confidence studies, more research into perceptual and assistive interfaces, and formal models of the state of the robot, state of the world, and information as to what has been observed.},

abstract = {Ego-motion estimation for an agile single camera moving through general, unknown scenes becomes a much more challenging problem when real-time performance is required rather than under the off-line processing conditions under which most successful structure from motion work has been achieved. This task of estimating camera motion from measurements of a continuously expanding set of self-mapped visual features is one of a class of problems known as Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM) in the robotics community, and we argue that such real-time mapping research, despite rarely being camera-based, is more relevant here than off-line structure from motion methods due to the more fundamental emphasis placed on propagation of uncertainty. We present a top-down Bayesian framework for single-camera localisation via mapping of a sparse set of natural features using motion modelling and an information-guided active measurement strategy, in particular addressing the difficult issue of real-time feature initialisation via a factored sampling approach. Real-time handling of uncertainty permits robust localisation via the creating and active measurement of a sparse map of landmarks such that regions can be re-visited after periods of neglect and localisation can continue through periods when few features are visible. Results are presented of real-time localisation for a hand-waved camera with very sparse prior scene knowledge and all processing carried out on a desktop PC.},

abstract = {We propose a hierarchical approach to 3D scattered data interpolation with compactly supported basis functions. Our numerical experiments suggest that the approach integrates the best aspects of scattered data fitting with locally and globally supported basis functions. Employing locally supported functions leads to an efficient computational procedure, while a coarse-to-fine hierarchy makes our method insensitive to the density of scattered data and allows us to restore large parts of missed data. Given a point cloud distributed along a surface, we first use spatial down sampling to construct a coarse-to-fine hierarchy of point sets. Then we interpolate the sets starting from the coarsest level. We interpolate a point set of the hierarchy, as an offsetting of the interpolating function computed at the previous level. An original point set and its coarse-to-fine hierarchy of interpolated sets is presented. According to our numerical experiments, the method is essentially faster than the state-of-the-art scattered data approximation with globally supported RBFs (Carr et al., 2001) and much simpler to implement.},

abstract = {This book is an introduction to level set methods and dynamic implicit surfaces. These are powerful techniques for analyzing and computing moving fronts in a variety of different settings. While it gives many examples of the utility of the methods to a diverse set of applications, it also gives complete numerical analysis and recipes, which will enable users to quickly apply the techniques to real problems. The book begins with a description of implicit surfaces and their basic properties, then devises the level set geometry and calculus toolbox, including the construction of signed distance functions. Part II adds dynamics to this static calculus. Topics include the level set equation itself, Hamilton-Jacobi equations, motion of a surface normal to itself, re-initialization to a signed distance function, extrapolation in the normal direction, the particle level set method and the motion of co-dimension two (and higher) objects. Part III is concerned with topics taken from the fields of Image Processing and Computer Vision. These include the restoration of images degraded by noise and blur, image segmentation with active contours (snakes), and reconstruction of surfaces from unorganized data points. Part IV is dedicated to Computational Physics. It begins with one phase compressible fluid dynamics, then two-phase compressible flow involving possibly different equations of state, detonation and deflagration waves, and solid/fluid structure interaction. Next it discusses incompressible fluid dynamics, including a computer graphics simulation of smoke, free surface flows, including a computer graphics simulation of water, and fully two-phase incompressible flow. Additional related topics include incompressible flames with applications to computer graphics and coupling a compressible and incompressible fluid. Finally, heat flow and Stefan problems are discussed. A student or researcher working in mathematics, computer graphics, science, or engineering interested in any dynamic moving front, which might change its topology or develop singularities, will find this book interesting and useful.},

By combining data from multiple maps when learning object models, the resulting models have higher fidelity than could be obtained from any single map. A Bayesian complexity measure is applied to determine the number of different objects in the model, making it possible to apply the approach to situations where not all objects are present at all times in the map.},

abstract = {Presents a framework of surface modeling from multi-view range data. The input to the algorithms are triangle meshes, each of which is from a single view range scan. The triangle meshes generated from raw data are first processed by the proposed area decreasing flow for surface denoising. Although the proposed flow is mathematically equivalent to the mean curvature flow, it can avoid the difficulty in curvature estimation and provide an optimal flowing step size. We introduce an adaptive triangle mesh smoothing scheme based on crease edge strength of each vertex using tensor voting of the normal vector field inside a geodesic window. The smoothing result makes surface normal estimation more accurate which is then used in surface mesh integration. Based on Hilton's implicit surface-based method, surfaces from multiple views are integrated into a single 3D model. We incorporate color images to generate textured models. The algorithms are successfully applied to surface modeling from range data using two types of range scanners.},

abstract = {Triangle meshes are widely used in representing surfaces in computer vision and computer graphics. Although 2D image processing-based edge detection techniques have been popular in many application areas, they are not well developed for surfaces represented by triangle meshes. This paper proposes a robust edge detection algorithm for triangle meshes and its applications to surface segmentation and adaptive surface smoothing. The proposed edge detection technique is based on eigen analysis of the surface normal vector field in a geodesic window. To compute the edge strength of a certain vertex, the neighboring vertices in a specified geodesic distance are involved. Edge information are used further to segment the surfaces with the watershed algorithm and to achieve edge-preserved, adaptive surface smoothing. The proposed algorithm is novel in robustly detecting edges on triangle meshes against noise. The 3D watershed algorithm is an extension from previous work. Experimental results on surfaces reconstructed from multi-view real range images are presented.},

abstract = {Edgebreaker is a simple technique for compressing 3D triangle meshes. We introduce here a new formulation, which leads to a simple implementation. We describe it in terms of a simple data structure, the Corner Table, which represents the connectivity of any manifold triangle mesh as two table of integers. For meshes that are homeomorphic to a sphere, Edgebreaker encodes these two tables with less than 2 bits per triangle. It compresses vertex locations using a parallelogram predictor. Entropy encoding reduces this cost in practice to less than a bit per triangle when the mesh is large. The detailed source code for the compression and the decompression algorithms fits on a single page. Through minor modifications, the Edgebreaker algorithm has been adapted to manifold meshes with holes and handles, to non- triangle meshes, and to non-manifold meshes. A Corner-Table implementation of these extensions will be described elsewhere.},

abstract = {The ICP (Iterative Closest Point) algorithm is widely used for geometric alignment of three-dimensional models when an initial estimate of the relative pose is known. Many variants of ICP have been proposed, affecting all phases of the algorithm from the selection and matching of points to the minimization strategy. We enumerate and classify many of these variants, and evaluate their effect on the speed with which the correct alignment is reached. In order to improve convergence for nearly-flat meshes with small features, such as inscribed surfaces, we introduce a new variant based on uniform sampling of the space of normals. We conclude by proposing a combination of ICP variants optimized for high speed. We demonstrate an implementation that is able to align two range images in a few tens of milliseconds, assuming a good initial guess. This capability has potential application to real-time 3D model acquisition and model-based tracking},

abstract = {In this paper, we address the problem of robust data association for simultaneous vehicle localization and map building. We show that the classical gated nearest neighbor approach, which considers each matching between sensor observations and features independently, ignores the fact that measurement prediction errors are correlated. This leads to easily accepting incorrect matchings when clutter or vehicle errors increase. We propose a new measurement of the joint compatibility of a set of pairings that successfully rejects spurious matchings. We show experimentally that this restrictive criterion can be used to efficiently search for the best solution to data association. Unlike the nearest neighbor, this method provides a robust solution in complex situations, such as cluttered environments or when revisiting previously mapped regions},

abstract = {The Ball-Pivoting Algorithm (BPA) computes a triangle mesh interpolating a given point cloud. Typically, the points are surface samples acquired with multiple range scans of an object. The principle of the BPA is very simple: Three points form a triangle if a ball of a user-specified radius p touches them without containing any other point. Starting with a seed triangle, the ball pivots around an edge (i.e., it revolves around the edge while keeping in contact with the edge's endpoints) until it touches another point, forming another triangle. The process continues until all reachable edges have been tried, and then starts from another seed triangle, until all points have been considered. The process can then be repeated with a ball of larger radius to handle uneven sampling densities. We applied the BPA to datasets of millions of points representing actual scans of complex 3D objects. The relatively small amount of memory required by the BPA, its time efficiency, and the quality of the results obtained compare favorably with existing techniques},

Drawing on recent techniques of global registration and correlation, we present a method, called local registration and global correlation, for reliable reconstruction of consistent global maps from dense range data. The method is attractive because it is incremental, producing an updated map with every new sensor input; and runs in constant time independent of the size of the map (except when closing large cycles).

abstract = {Our research addresses how to integrate exploration and localization for mobile robots. A robot exploring and mapping an unknown environment needs to know its own location, but it may need a map in order to determine that location. In order to solve this problem, we have developed ARIEL, a mobile robot system that combines frontier based exploration with continuous localization. ARIEL explores by navigating to frontiers, regions on the boundary between unexplored space and space that is known to be open. ARIEL finds these regions in the occupancy grid map that it builds as it explores the world. ARIEL localizes by matching its recent perceptions with the information stored in the occupancy grid. We have implemented ARIEL on a real mobile robot and tested ARIEL in a real-world office environment. We present quantitative results that demonstrate that ARIEL can localize accurately while exploring, and thereby build accurate maps of its environment},

abstract = {Evidence grids provide a uniform representation for fusing temporally and spatially distinct sensor readings. However, the use of evidence grids requires that the robot be localized within its environment. Odometry errors typically accumulate over time, making localization estimates degrade, and introducing significant errors into evidence grids as they are built. We have addressed this problem by developing a method for “continuous localization”, in which the robot corrects its localization estimates incrementally and on the fly. Assuming the mobile robot has a map of its environment represented as an evidence grid, localization is achieved by building a series of “local perception grids” based on localized sensor readings and the current odometry, and then registering the local and global grids. The registration produces an offset which is used to correct the odometry. Results are given on the effectiveness of this method, and quantify the improvement of continuous localization over dead reckoning. We also compare different techniques for matching evidence grids and for searching registration offsets},

abstract = {This article surveys deformable models, a promising and vigorously researched computer-assisted medical image analysis technique. Among model-based techniques, deformable models offer a unique and powerful approach to image analysis that combines geometry, physics and approximation theory. They have proven to be effective in segmenting, matching and tracking anatomic structures by exploiting (bottom-up) constraints derived from the image data together with (top-down) a priori knowledge about the location, size and shape of these structures. Deformable models are capable of accommodating the significant variability of biological structures over time and across different individuals. Furthermore, they support highly intuitive interaction mechanisms that, when necessary, allow medical scientists and practitioners to bring their expertise to bear on the model-based image interpretation task. This article reviews the rapidly expanding body of work on the development and application of deformable models to problems of fundamental importance in medical image analysis, including segmentation, shape representation, matching and motion tracking.},

abstract = {This paper presents a physics-based approach to anatomical surface segmentation, reconstruction, and tracking in multidimensional medical images. The approach makes use of a dynamic "balloon" model--a spherical thin-plate under tension surface spline which deforms elastically to fit the image data. The fitting process is mediated by internal forces stemming from the elastic properties of the spline and external forces which are produced form the data. The forces interact in accordance with Lagrangian equations of motion that adjust the model's deformational degrees of freedom to fit the data. We employ the finite element method to represent the continuous surface in the form of weighted sums of local polynomial basis functions. We use a quintic triangular finite element whose nodal variables include positions as well as the first and second partial derivatives of the surface. We describe a system, implemented on a high performance graphics workstation, which applies the model fitting technique to the segmentation of the cardiac LV surface in volume (3D) CT images and LV tracking in dynamic volume (4D) CT images to estimate its nonrigid motion over the cardiac cycle. The system features a graphical user interface which minimizes error by affording specialist users interactive control over the dynamic model fitting process.},

abstract = {We present a new algorithm, called marching cubes, that creates triangle models of constant density surfaces from 3D medical data. Using a divide-and-conquer approach to generate inter-slice connectivity, we create a case table that defines triangle topology. The algorithm processes the 3D medical data in scan-line order and calculates triangle vertices using linear interpolation. We find the gradient of the original data, normalize it, and use it as a basis for shading the models. The detail in images produced from the generated surface models is the result of maintaining the inter-slice connectivity, surface data, and gradient information present in the original 3D data. Results from computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance (MR), and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) illustrate the quality and functionality of marching cubes. We also discuss improvements that decrease processing time and add solid modeling capabilities.},
